## How it works…
**ngOnChanges** is one of the many life cycle hooks Angular provides out of the box. It
triggers even before the **ngOnInit** hook. So, you get the initial values in the first call
and the updated values later on. Whenever any of the inputs change, the ngOnChanges
callback is triggered with **SimpleChanges** and you can get the previous value, the
current value, and a Boolean representing whether this is the first change to the input
(that is, the initial value). When we update the value of the vName input in the parent,
**ngOnChanges** gets called with the updated value. Then, based on the situation, we add
an appropriate log into our logs array and display it on the UI
