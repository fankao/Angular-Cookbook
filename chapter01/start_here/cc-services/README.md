## How it works…
BehaviorSubject is a special type of Observable that requires an initial value
and can be used by many subscribers. In this recipe, we create a BehaviorSubject
and then create an Observable using the .asObservable() method on
BehaviorSubject. Although we could've just used BehaviorSubject, using the
.asObservable() approach is recommended by the community.
Once we have created the Observable named count$ in NotificationsService, we
inject NotificationsService in our components and assign the count$ Observable
to a local property of the components. Then, we subscribe to this local property (which is
an Observable) directly in NotificationsButtonComponent's template (html) and
in NotificationsManagerComponent's template using the async pipes.
Then, whenever we need to update the value of the count$ Observable, we use
the setCount method of NotificationsService to update the actual
BehaviorSubject's value by using the .next() method on it. This automatically
emits this new value via the count$ Observable and updates the view with the new
value in both of the components.
